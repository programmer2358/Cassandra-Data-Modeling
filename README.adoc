= Cassandra Data Modeling

== https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DataModel[Introduction:]

Cassandra is a partitioned row store, where rows are organized into tables with a required primary key.

The first component of a table's primary key is the partition key; within a partition, rows are clustered by the remaining columns of the PK. Other columns may be indexed independent of the PK.

This allows pervasive denormalization to "pre-build" resultsets at update time, rather than doing expensive joins across the cluster.
